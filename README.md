Quick Idea layout document for the game that is 

 - "A love letter to Super Metroid" -



Gameplay 


Begin by unlocking the basic ability to jump using basic movement.
And use jumping as a means of defeating a basic boss
NOTE MAKE JUMPING ALREADY BE AN ABILIT, just feels retarded for a platformer. 

Nice to haves:
- Metroid Dread level completionist info without the whole /outta ten thing. only a badge that appears when all items in an area are collected.
- BOSS MUSIC
- more than basic bosses.



Begining abilities:
- Basic movement and aiming like super metroid (NO need to reinvent the wheel there.)
- A rather lacking jump to start, like imagine getting off a trampoline and your mind is adjusting to that.
- Start with gun

Abilties unlocked later: 
- Space Jump 
- High-Jump lol (Use slight timings like smash.)
- Rolling Amour 
- Motion Charge ( Not speed booster it works differently. Sliding down slope, rolling, or any form of jumpping off a large cliff and gaining momentum can be stored with a timed a down input )
- Amour Lock (Become inmoveable, if enemies run into you they take damage. But take away health in a similar fasion to amour. )
- Double Sheath (A means of charging the gun for a power attack. Also preludes a sword ) 
- Sword (Slashes things, allows for flexability in combat. )
- Sword gains a sharp tip
- Sword gains broad side. 
- Sword gains rock breaking bits.
- Sword Block timing, that mimics a parry but that gives player more options than an advantage, or damage like in dread.

- Gun (Wave) Swtichable  (A)_
- Gun (Ice Beam <3) Limited Maybe something like Fusion's ice missles?
- Gun (Bomb Shot use as means of tying with montion charge.) Limited
- Gun (Spread like Contra ,) (B)
- Gun (Focus Laser for damage, reduces movement.) (C)
- X-Ray you know lol. 
- Bomb (Shrapnel) Limited
- Bomb (Nuke) Limited 
- Bomb (Acid-gas-bomb) Limited
- Amour Upgrade (A) Fire
- Amour upgrade (B) Fuck Water gravity
- Amour Upgrade (C) Freezing

Map design:
- 7 (regions) 
- Should make a web to show all the regions together and their short cuts
- Super Metorid level map design. 
- 8th region but its not really, just a stage for the last boss (Kinda) I still want upgrades there. 


Story: 
I want to think about this more. 
Earth, some person from the country is going into a big city (that has been walled off) and they are looking for a cure of sorts for their loved ones. Protag was once trained in the amry, but is looking to go into the city to grab some of the cure that was being developed.
to get there they have to access a locked down facility deep in the city with currpted.
outside the city walls there is militia, that are letting people go in  under the restrcition that they go in with a super human suit of sorts, they give info that mulitple bases inside the city fell but the locked down laboratoy that has a cure. its just the infected in the city overwheled forces else where. But they are just holding the wall as a last report from the higher ups. othwerwise if there are scietnists and cures is unkonwn information. So you go in and Search for the cure. Also your loved one is incapcitated, in a sub-coma form.
